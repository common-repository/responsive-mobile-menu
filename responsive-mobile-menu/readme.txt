**Menu icon will not show up**
Under the menu button options you need to use the correct class selector or id selector including the corresponding dot “.” for class selector and the hash “#” for the ID selectors.
Class selectors are declared with a dot  “.”  preceding a string of one or more characters. The string of characters is defined by the developer.
 
ID selector is declared using a hash, or pound symbol “#”. Just as is the case with an Class selector, this string of characters is defined by the developer.
